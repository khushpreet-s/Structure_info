Introduction\\nIn a rapidly transforming and increasingly digitalized society, interest in artificial\\nintelligence (AI) is growing. Artificial intelligence (AI) has received increasing attention\\nfrom various areas of society, industry, and business [ 1]. AI is referred to as the Fourth\\nIndustrial Revolution [ 2]. AI is a field that combines computer science with large datasets to\\nimprove the quality of business decision making. Artificial intelligence is the simulation of\\nhuman intelligence by machines (programs) using technologies such as machine learning,\\ndeep learning, data mining, natural language processing, image recognition, and more [ 3,4].\\nAI and big data empower people to systematize disaggregated information in a system\\nand transform data into actionable business decisions, thus accelerating company-wide\\ndecision making [ 5–7]. Several studies have examined AI adoption and its influence\\non business performance by reducing costs and enhancing forecasting [ 8], improving\\nbusiness operations [ 9], delivering increased productivity by substituting typical human\\neveryday jobs with automation [ 10], enhancing product innovation [ 11], and fostering\\nfirm growth [ 12,13]. Hence, businesses are focusing more on AI, and there is tremendous\\npotential for AI to enhance the performance of firms [ 14], but there are also major obstacles\\nto the adoption of AI by companies [15].\\nSustainability 2024 ,16, 1864. https://doi.org/10.3390/su16051864 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 2 of 24\\nResearchers in academia consider the influence and implications of AI technology to\\nbe the most important research area [ 16], as acceptance of AI practices also impacts the\\nfinancial and non-financial performance of SMEs [ 17]. Studying the mechanisms and key\\nfactors of the impact of AI on firm performance has significant theoretical and practical\\nvalue [ 18]. Consequently, there is a compelling need to investigate the multidimensional\\nfactors (particularly qualitative factors) that influence the adoption of AI within SMEs.\\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an essential driver of economic de-\\nvelopment [ 19] and are essential for most economies around the world, especially in\\ndeveloping and emerging countries [ 20]. Unlike large companies, SMEs are highly resilient\\nto technical change and have better adaptability to market fluctuations, while making fast\\ndecisions due to their organizational structure [ 21,22]. SMEs use disruptive technologies to\\nexpand their businesses and advance their operational activities [ 23]. The current industrial\\nrevolution has driven up the demand for SMEs to adopt digital technology [ 24,25]. Due\\nto pressure from stakeholders, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have recently\\nbegun to take on innovation initiatives [ 19]. Saudi Arabia is a leading oil-producing country\\nin the world [ 26] and is experiencing rapid industrial and economic growth. The Ministry\\nof Labor and Social Development estimates that Saudi Arabian SMEs contribute approxi-\\nmately 22 percent of the kingdom’s gross domestic product. Approximately 34% of Saudi\\nworkers were employed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in 2019 [ 21]. Saudi\\nArabia has implemented Vision 2030, which is a strategic document to foster growth and\\nencourage innovation adoption in each sector of the country; hence, SMEs are supported\\nto adopt new technologies and environmentally friendly production processes [ 27,28]. A\\nprevious study in the context of Saudi Arabian SMEs and AI by Baabdullah et al. (2021)\\nlaid the foundation by investigating the antecedents and consequences of AI practices\\nwithin B2B firms and calling for more research into AI adoption [ 17]. Moreover, a study\\nutilized the integrated technology acceptance model (TAM)–TOE model to understand\\nfactors influencing AI adoption within firms [ 29]. Hence, to add to the literature, the\\npresent study utilizes the Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) framework to\\nconstruct a research model that explains the readiness of firms towards the adoption of AI\\nand the firm performance within SMEs in emerging countries like Saudi Arabia. Secondly,\\nmost previous studies tend to treat performance as a one-dimensional construct [ 30,31].\\nIn this study, the authors conceptualize performance as a two-dimensional construct (i.e.,\\noperational and economic performance). To the authors’ knowledge, this study is the\\nfirst research work focusing on SMEs’ AI adoption and its impact on performance as a\\ntwo-dimensional construct (i.e., operational and economic performance) in Saudi Arabia.\\nLastly, firm size was used as a moderator variable to understand the group differences\\nbetween small and medium-sized SMEs.\\n2. Literature Review\\n2.1. Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) Framework\\nIn organizational studies on innovation diffusion and adoption, two widely utilized\\ntheories are the diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory [ 32] and the Technology–Organization–\\nEnvironment (TOE) framework [ 33]. This research excludes other prevalent theories like\\nthe technology acceptance model (TAM) [ 34], the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [ 35],\\nand the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) [ 36] as they pri-\\nmarily address individual decision-making processes. This study only utilizes the TOE\\nframework. The TOE framework [ 33] provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing\\nthe interplay between technology characteristics, organizational factors, and environmental\\ninfluences in shaping the adoption decisions of organizations. The TOE framework offers\\na theoretical perspective for analyzing the adoption of innovative technology within or-\\nganizations [ 37]. TOE is a classical framework that suggests general factors that explain\\nand predict innovation and technology adoption probability [ 33]. The framework pro-\\nposes three business context components that impact the adoption and implementation ofSustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 3 of 24\\ntechnological advances. Technology development [ 38], organizational conditions [ 39], and\\nindustry environment [40] make up the TOE framework.\\nThe TOE framework has been utilized in many prior studies in various contexts of\\ntechnology. Scupola, in his study, focused on understanding and presenting a comprehen-\\nsive analysis of the adoption of Internet commerce by SMEs utilizing the TOE framework,\\nconsidering various external and internal factors tailored to the unique context of southern\\nItaly [ 41]. Furthermore, researchers investigated the determinants of cloud computing adop-\\ntion in the manufacturing and services sectors, offering insights into the factors influencing\\norganizations’ decisions to adopt cloud technologies [ 42]. In addition, an earlier work also\\nshows that TOE framework constructs are more likely to apply to large companies [ 43].\\nExtending the TOE framework, studies have employed it to explain the adoption of specific\\ntechnological innovations. For instance, the model has been applied to understand the\\nadoption of electronic customer relationship management (eCRM) systems [ 44], cloud com-\\nputing [ 45,46], geographical information technologies [ 47], blockchain technology [ 48,49],\\ne-business [50], green banking practice [51], and other emerging technologies.\\nA recent study has attempted to integrate TAM and TOE to provide a robust framework\\nfor analyzing and enhancing the adoption of AI technologies in construction firms [ 52]. In\\naddition, an extended TOE framework has been empirically tested to analyze the utilization\\nof online retailing in the digital transformation of the Vietnamese business landscape [53].\\nAnother study in the context of AI [ 42] conducted a comparative case study to explore the\\nadoption of artificial intelligence in public organizations, providing insights into the factors\\nand dynamics shaping AI adoption in the public sector. Another study has investigated\\nthe antecedents of MLOps (machine learning operations) adoption, employing the TOE\\nframework for analysis [54].\\nRecently, a few studies have investigated AI adoption in the context of SMEs to\\nexamine AI technology’s applicability in different situations such as AI-based Business-to-\\nBusiness (B2B) practices [ 17] and accounting automation [ 24]. Moreover, a study examined\\nthe determinants of performance in the adoption of artificial intelligence within the hospi-\\ntality industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, shedding light on factors influencing the\\nsuccessful integration of AI technologies utilizing the TOE framework [ 55]. A foundational\\nstudy conducted in the realm of Saudi Arabian SMEs and AI explored the precursors\\nand outcomes of AI practices in B2B firms [ 17], prompting further investigation into AI\\nadoption. Additionally, another study employed the integrated technology acceptance\\nmodel (TAM)–TOE model to comprehend the factors shaping AI adoption within organi-\\nzations [ 29]. This article makes a dual contribution. Firstly, it delves into both the direct\\nand indirect impacts of TOE characteristics on AI adoption. Secondly, it provides a more\\ncomprehensive evaluation of the factors influencing AI adoption compared to previous\\nstudies and further investigates how AI adoption decisions will affect firm performance in\\nthe context of Saudi SMEs.\\n2.2. Hypothesis Development\\n2.2.1. Technological Readiness\\nTechnological readiness represents the set of technologies available to a company [ 41].\\nTechnological features can be viewed as cognitive beliefs of workers reflected in attitudes\\ntowards technological innovation and can influence the adoption of innovation [ 56]. Vari-\\nous technological factors that include comparative advantage, compatibility, complexity,\\ntestability, traceability, ease of use, perceived usefulness, the intensity of information, and\\nuncertainty have been investigated [ 24,56,57]. The focus of this study is cost, relative\\nadvantage, compatibility, and complexity.\\nCost is seen as one of the main obstacles to adopting technologies [ 58,59]. The costs\\ninclude implementation costs, such as the financial and human resources required for\\nthe implementation [ 33]. However, it is believed that high implementation costs could\\nmotivate innovation users to take innovations seriously and employ them proactively to\\nmake innovation adoption more cost-effective [ 60]. The higher investment to adopt AISustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 4 of 24\\nmay be an obstacle and may result in firms’ reluctance to simplify interpretations and\\nheightened sensitivity to errors and unusual occurrences, regardless of their size. Thus, the\\nfollowing hypothesis was formulated:\\nH1(a): Implementation cost has a negative effect on AI adoption .\\nRelative advantage is defined as the extent to which an innovation is considered better\\nthan its predecessors [ 32]. Organizations are more likely to choose technology that offers\\nbetter performance and higher financial returns than other technologies [ 60]. Relative\\nadvantage is positively related to innovation adoption [ 61]; the greater the relative advan-\\ntage, the faster the adoption of innovation. Studies have shown that relative advantage\\nis positively related to the adoption of innovation [ 62,63]. For SMEs, AI produces several\\nrelative benefits: reduced costs, quick decision making, and forecasting. In a highly com-\\npetitive market, these benefits are essential for companies. Further, a study indicates that\\nrelative advantage strongly influences AI adoption [ 64]. Hence, the following hypothesis\\nwas formulated:\\nH1(b): Relative advantage has a positive effect on AI adoption .\\nComplexity is the extent to which an innovation is considered relatively difficult to\\nunderstand and use [ 60]. Technological complexity refers to difficulties in learning to\\nstudy and understand new technologies [ 65], and it is commonly believed that complexity\\nhas a negative impact on innovation adoption [ 66]. In addition, a study indicates that\\nexcessive technological complexity decreases the ability to perform competently [ 67]. The\\nexisting literature on the diffusion of innovations has shown that the acceptance rate\\ndecreases with the increasing complexity of implementing an innovation [ 68,69]. AI can\\nbe challenging [ 64], yet different applications have different levels of complexity, making\\nit interesting to study. In the context of AI, if the managers find the AI technology to be\\ncomplicated to implement and understand, they will likely avoid the AI adoption within\\nfirm. Therefore, we hypothesize:\\nH1(c): Complexity has a negative effect on AI adoption .\\nCompatibility is the degree to which innovation is seen as compatible with a com-\\npany’s existing values, experience, and needs [ 70]. Technology compatibility is a necessary\\nrequirement: when green innovation requires resources that are not available to the organi-\\nzation or creates change that is not in line with its strategy, implementation becomes very\\ndifficult [37]. Previous studies suggest that compatibility positively influences innovation\\nadoption [ 37,61,71]. A similar notion will be observed when adopting AI and its compat-\\nibility. If SMEs believe AI technology meets all their work requirements and innovation\\nprerequisites, they are going to be more receptive to implementing it [ 24]. Therefore, we\\npostulated the following hypotheses.\\nH1(d): Compatibility has a positive effect on AI adoption .\\n2.2.2. Organizational Readiness\\nOrganizational readiness refers to the distinctiveness, structures, processes, and re-\\nsources that limit or facilitate the adoption of technological innovation [ 72]. A number of\\norganizational variables, such as the quality of human resources, top manager leadership\\nskills, organizational support, and organizational culture, have been discussed in relation\\nto green innovation adoption [ 73,74]. Previous studies have focused primarily on organiza-\\ntional support and sustainable human capital, as these factors have consistently proven\\nto be more important in influencing green innovation adoption [ 75,76]. Hence, this studySustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 5 of 24\\nadopts the same variable in the organizational context to check how these factors influence\\nAI adoption.\\nOrganizational support refers to the extent to which a company helps employees use a\\nparticular technology or system [ 77]. Stimulating innovation and ensuring the availability\\nof financial and technical resources for new technology or innovation positively affect the\\nuptake of innovation [ 78]. Top management plays a vital role in providing organizational\\nsupport. To ensure the successful implementation of AI initiatives, top management’s main\\ntask is to acquire resources and allocate them efficiently, so that companies can achieve a\\ncompetitive advantage [ 79,80]. Therefore, the authors postulated the following hypotheses:\\nH2(a): Organizational support has a positive effect on AI adoption .\\nSustainable human resource management is the combination of the sustainability\\nconcept with HR [ 81] that enables firms to have sustainable human capital. In response to\\nthe dynamic nature of the business environment, firms are actively seeking to include artifi-\\ncial intelligence (AI) as a catalyst for significant change. The role of the human resources\\ndepartment in facilitating the change becomes pivotal for industry 4.0 adoption [ 82]. Many\\nstudies highlight the importance of sustainable human resource (SHR) policies in shaping\\nan organization’s ability and readiness to embrace artificial intelligence (AI), as AI-based\\nsystems will significantly change the nature of the workforce [ 83,84]. Concurrently, there\\nhas been an increased emphasis on the adoption of sustainable human resource (HR) prac-\\ntices by organizations [ 8] as they endeavor to harmonize their activities with principles of\\nenvironmental, social, and economic sustainability [ 81]. Sustainable human resources (HR)\\npractices involve a diverse array of techniques and activities that are designed to cultivate\\na work environment conducive to the long-term promotion of well-being, equity, and orga-\\nnizational resilience to new advancements, and to reducing the skill gap through employee\\ndevelopment initiatives and training and rewards aimed at fostering work–life equilibrium\\nand employee well-being, for the implementation of new digital technologies [ 8,81,85].\\nThe increasing prevalence of AI technology and the several benefits outlined have led\\nto a corresponding rise in the need for skills connected to AI [ 86]. The implementation\\nof sustainable human resources (HR) strategies that emphasize employee development\\nand upskilling can effectively provide the workforce with the essential skills required\\nfor the effective application of artificial intelligence (AI). Organizations may effectively\\nequip their human capital to adapt to the ever-changing technology landscape by making\\ninvestments in ongoing learning and development initiatives, to have sustainable human\\ncapital to obtain long-term sustainability [ 87]. The presence of skilled human capital and\\nthe dedication of managers to learn and embrace new technology are imperative and seen\\nas one of the main factors that motivate companies to invest in innovative technology [ 88].\\nSustainable human capital can minimize uncertainty, tolerate risk, and reduce resistance to\\ninnovation and green practices [ 89]. However, the literature on sustainable human capital\\nis still limited [ 90], especially in the context of AI. Therefore, the authors expect that having\\nsustainable human capital will positively affect AI adoption and postulate the following\\nhypothesis:\\nH2(b): Sustainable human capital has a positive effect on AI adoption .\\n2.2.3. Environmental Readiness\\nEnvironmental readiness factors refer to the external pressures that cause a company to\\npursue technological innovation [ 37]. Various environmental variables, such as market and\\ncustomer pressure, stakeholder pressure, government role, and environmental regulation,\\nhave been discussed in the literature [ 74,76]. This study mainly focuses on market and\\ncustomer support and government support in the context of AI adoption.\\nCompanies need to understand their target customers and anticipate changing pref-\\nerences, in order to be able to react quickly to market demand and gain a competitiveSustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 6 of 24\\nadvantage [ 91]. Customers are the end-users of the product, so customer demand may\\nhave a more significant influence than any other factor in encouraging manufacturers\\nto innovate [ 92]. Prior studies suggest that markets and customers encourage compa-\\nnies to focus on adopting new innovations [ 74,76,92]. Therefore, this study proposed the\\nfollowing hypothesis.\\nH3(a): Market and customer demand has a positive effect on AI adoption .\\nGovernment support refers to assistance or facilitating conditions provided to the\\nemployees or organization to transform or implement technology diffusion within the firm.\\nFacilitating conditions are the individual’s perception that there is the necessary technical\\nand organizational capacity and infrastructure for them to be able to successfully use new\\ntechnologies [ 36]. This factor has been used in various studies that have investigated\\nusage preference or the continued usage of new technology [ 93,94]. Governments facilitate\\nthrough monetary incentives or government subsidies and making credit available from\\ncommercial banks for implementing technological innovations and encouraging SMEs [ 95].\\nTherefore, due to resource constraints, SMEs need additional resources and government\\nsupport (GS). Therefore, the authors postulate the following hypothesis.\\nH3(b): Government support has a positive effect on AI adoption .\\n2.2.4. Artifical Intelligence Adoption and Sustainable Business Performance\\nAI adoption reduces expenses and improves forecasts and business operations [ 8,9].\\nThus, organizations are focusing increasingly on AI, which has great potential to improve\\nperformance [ 14]. As AI adoption affects SME financial and non-financial performance [ 17],\\nexamining the AI implementation process and key determinants on business performance\\nholds both theoretical and practical significance [ 18]. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial\\nintelligence powered by big data analytics, and green innovations are just a few examples\\nof Industry 4.0 elements that can improve sustainable business performance [ 96]. Recently,\\nperformance has been classified into three primary components, which are environmental,\\neconomic, and operational [ 97]. This study has only included two dimensions of sustainable\\nbusiness performance, namely, operational and economic performance, though a few\\nstudies have mentioned three dimensions from the perspective of SMEs, as they are critical\\nfor sustainable innovation and business performance [21].\\nOperational performance is determined by a combination of efficient product develop-\\nment, process development, quality compliance, and short lead times [ 98]. A company’s\\nability to apply AI practices improves certain aspects of its operations and helps in achiev-\\ning efficiency (e.g., cost reduction, elimination of a liability, etc.). Moreover, AI adoption\\nincreases productivity by the automation of tasks [ 10] and enhances product innovation [ 11],\\nwhich in turn improves competitiveness [ 97]. These innovative measures can improve\\nthe quality of operations and reduce production costs by raising the production process’s\\nefficiency and lowering input and waste disposal costs. Therefore, this study proposes the\\nfollowing hypothesis:\\nH4(a): AI adoption positively affects operational performance .\\nThe economic performance dimension refers to a firm’s financial health and growth.\\nFirms that adopt AI technology can experience an increase in revenue, as AI can help\\nfirms to better understand their customers and make more accurate predictions about\\ntheir behavior. AI adoption has clearly reduced the cost of production and allowed for\\nefficiency in decision making that adds to increase profitability and improved financial\\nperformance [ 5,17]. According to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute, AI adoption\\ncan increase global GDP by up to 1.2% annually by 2030 [ 99]. Furthermore, AI can helpSustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 7 of 24\\nfirms to reduce costs by automating repetitive tasks and optimizing processes [ 10,100].\\nTherefore, this study proposed the following hypothesis.\\nH4(b): AI adoption positively affects economic performance .\\n2.2.5. Firm Size as Moderator\\nSome literature has been written about the determinants of innovation and, in particu-\\nlar, about the influence of company size on innovation [ 21]. Company size is repeatedly\\nviewed as a relevant organizational characteristic that influences innovation adoption. For\\ninstance, the positive influence of firm size was revealed on e-maintenance readiness [ 75],\\nconsistent with these findings. But another study finds that firm size has little effect on\\ntechnology adoption [ 101]. This variability in quantifying the impact of firm size could\\nbe accounted for by factors such as the type of technology adopted and how firm size\\nis measured [ 75]. In general, large companies tend to adopt environmentally friendly\\npractices more quickly than small companies because they have adequate resources and\\nvital infrastructure [102].\\nRecent empirical studies have shown that small companies are much less innovative\\nthan large companies [ 101,103–105]. The reason for this is that, even though large com-\\npanies may benefit from technological and learning economies of scale, organizational\\ndifferences in size may outweigh these [ 106,107]. As a result, small businesses are more\\nlikely to be subject to resource and material constraints in innovation than large com-\\npanies, while large companies are more likely to be subject to behavioral constraints in\\ninnovation. In this study, within the SME’s context, small and medium firm-size as an\\norganizational characteristic has been taken as a moderator to check whether there are\\nsignificant differences and influences on AI adoption and firm performance.

Two sub-constructs were included\\nfor the organizational factor: sustainable human capital [ 75,111] and organizational sup-\\nport [ 74]. The environmental factor was measured by two sub-constructs, including gov-\\nernment support and market and customer factors; each sub-construct contained four\\nitems adapted from a previous study [ 74]. AI adoption (AIA) items were modified in the\\nquestionnaire and adopted from previous studies [ 75,112]. Lastly, sustainable business per-\\nformance consisted of two distinct components: economic performance with two items and\\noperational performance with two items. All measures of firm performance were modified\\nand adapted from prior research [ 21,37,113], and all the questionnaire items were finalized\\nfor survey (refer Appendix A). A self-administered survey method with random sampling\\nwas adopted to obtain data for this study. Random sampling is considered the most suitable\\nstrategy due to the equal probability assigned to each unit [114]. Prospective respondents\\nwere identified through a systematic approach, leveraging industry directories, business\\nassociations, and government records. The finalized questionnaire was distributed to SME\\nexecutives at middle or senior level or the owner/entrepreneur from the construction,\\nenergy, logistics, manufacturing, and services industries in the Jeddah industrial area fromSustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 10 of 24\\nMarch 2023 till May 2023. Approximately 300 respondents were approached and 220 valid\\nresponses from the industry were processed for data analysis. In Saudi Arabia, SMEs are\\ncompanies with 250 or fewer employees and an annual revenue of less than SAR 200 million\\n(USD 53.3 million). According to data from the Saudi Nitaqat and the General Authority\\nfor Statistics (GaStat), the authors classify businesses as either small (6–49 employees) or\\nmedium (50–249 employees). Among the 220 responses, 115 were from medium-sized\\nbusinesses and 105 were from small businesses. Table 2 displays the demographic analysis\\nof the data collected.\\nTable 2.

A number larger than 0.5 for the average variance\\nextracted suggests a high level of validity for both the variable and construct. The loading\\nvalues of items should fall within the range of 0.05 and 0.07. It was noted that a single\\nitem, namely sustainable human capital SHC3, had a low value and was therefore removed\\nfrom the analysis. The assessment of convergent validity was conducted within three main\\nconditions: The values of the standardized factor loads were found to be more than 0.5.\\nThe study found that the composite reliability (C.R) measure was greater than the average\\nvariance extracted (AVE) measure. Additionally, the AVE measure surpassed the threshold\\nof 0.5, as recommended [ 115]. Consequently, a mere 28 elements within the complete\\nmodel have factor loadings exceeding the threshold of 0.55. Please refer to Table 3 and\\nFigure 2 for further details.

Discussion and Conclusions\\nIn terms of technological factors, this study found that cost had an insignificant effect\\non AI adoption; the result is inconsistent with past studies [ 40,119,120]. The results of\\nthis study reveal that for Saudi SMEs, the cost of implementation does not seem to be a\\nbarrier to adopting AI, which implies that Saudi SMEs have sufficient financial resources\\nto invest in technology processes such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, green\\nmanufacturing, design, eco-labeling, and packaging. In addition, Saudi SMEs are also\\nable to invest in capacity-building and training their employees to manage and cope with\\nadvanced technologies. Relative advantage has a significant impact on AI adoption; this\\nfinding is consistent with past studies [ 74,121]; the results show that managers in Saudi\\nSMEs perceive AI to be better than the existing or substitute technology. The results also\\nshow that the relative advantages of AI increase SMEs’ willingness to adopt AI; this means\\nthat Saudi SMEs feel that the adoption of AI technology has improved and will improve\\ntheir reputation and corporate image. Complexity showed a negative but insignificant\\nimpact on AI adoption; the findings are in line with the previous literature [ 119,122,123].\\nThe results suggest that AI technology is inherently complex, so Saudi SMEs are not ready\\nto adopt it. Therefore, complexity may be a fundamental problem in the adoption of\\nAI technology, as technology incorporates and combines heterogeneous computing and\\nmachine learning technologies and requires insightful knowledge resources [ 124]. This\\ncould have an impact on the adoption of AI among SMEs in Saudi Arabia. However,\\nmanagers’ perceptions about compatibility showed a significant relationship with AI\\nadoption. The findings show that Saudi Arabian SMEs have believed that AI is not simple\\nor easy to learn, but that it is compatible with their current business activities and the\\nsetup of the organization. The reason for this may be that innovation complements current\\nbusiness technologies; the application of AI is not a single event but can be described as a\\nprocess of knowledge-gathering and integration.\\nFor organizational readiness factors, this study found organizational support has a\\nnon-significant relationship with AI adoption; the finding is inconsistent with prior stud-\\nies [70,125]. The results show that management within Saudi SMEs is not encouraging the\\nadoption of AI. Lack of organizational support for AI is mainly due to high costs, long pay-\\nback times, difficulties in protecting intellectual property, and high follow-up costs. These\\nchallenges prevent companies from supporting AI initiatives from the beginning [ 126].\\nSustainable human capital has a significant impact on AI. This finding is consistent with\\nprevious research that confirms that sustainable human capital positively impacts the adop-\\ntion of AI [ 127–129]. The significant association found in this study between sustainable\\nhuman capital and the adoption of AI is likely for several reasons. First, human capital\\nis the most critical resource that contributes significantly to the acceptance of sustainable\\ntechnologies [ 130]; this study shows that the Saudi workforce is equipped with skills\\nand knowledge, as significant investment has been made in the development of people.\\nTherefore, it seems that human resource practices and employee readiness are potential\\nplus points for accepting AI and other innovations within firms. The correlation between\\nsustainable human capital and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is intricate and crucial\\nfor firms aiming to utilize AI technology, while upholding their dedication to sustainability.\\nThe successful use of artificial intelligence (AI) can be enhanced by having sustainable\\nhuman capital, which encompasses several aspects such as diversity and inclusion and\\ntrained employees. The role of human resources (HR) in cultivating a sustainable and\\nwell-prepared workforce for the era of artificial intelligence (AI) is of growing importance,\\nas AI continues to change the future of work.\\nIn terms of environmental readiness, market and customer demand factors have a big\\neffect on innovation adoption in Saudi Arabia. This is in line with previous studies [ 74,76].\\nThe significant relationship between MC and AI adoption, which can be explained bySustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 16 of 24\\ncustomer demand for innovative and cutting-edge products, has increased. As a result,\\norganizations believe that the growth potential of AI is immense and are ready to capture\\nthe market and take risks in developing eco-innovative products because of this belief.\\nGovernment support significantly impacted AI adoption; the findings are in line with\\nthe available prior literature [ 74,95,131]. In previous studies, government policies such as\\nproviding monetary incentives, scientific resources, pilot projects, and training programs\\nhave been identified as driving factors for SMEs to adopt new technology and green prac-\\ntices [ 74,131–133]. In the case of Saudi Arabia, government support for SMEs for technology\\nis available through the General Authority of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Saudi\\nArabia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Small and Medium-Sized\\nEnterprises aims to improve firm performance in environmental protection, rehabilitation,\\nconservation and general improvement, pollution prevention and control, and promot-\\ning sustainable development. In addition, the SME Authority thoroughly reviews laws,\\nregulates, removes barriers, and facilitates SMEs and entrepreneurs to market their ideas\\nand products. The authority will also help SMEs develop their skills and networks and\\nprovide modern technical assistance to companies in pollution control. They will support\\nSMEs with marketing, help them export their goods and services through e-commerce, and\\nwork with international stakeholders. As part of Saudi Vision 2030, the kingdom plans\\nto increase SME investment from its current 20% of GDP to 35% to facilitate their access\\nto finance and encourage financial institutions to increase their current lending from 5%\\nto 20%.\\nThe present study has discovered a significant relationship between the adoption of\\nartificial intelligence (AI) and the economic and operational performance of small and\\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia. The findings indicate that the use of\\nartificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to provide favorable results, and hence, the\\neconomic and operational performance of SMEs increases simultaneously. The relationship\\nbetween AI and economic performance was found to be significant; the finding supports\\npast studies [ 76,134,135]. The findings show that Saudi SMEs have realized that eco-\\ninnovation is a key factor in financial performance. It suggests that when SMEs adopt\\ntechnological innovation in their products and process improvements, it is likely to lead\\nto significant changes in the productivity of their resources. These process improvements\\ncould reduce costs and, in turn, lead to better financial results. The relationship between\\nAI and operational performance was found to be significant in parallel with the literature\\navailable in the past [ 97,136]. This finding shows that Saudi SMEs believed that the\\nadoption of AI technologies in production and processes that lead to high efficiency and\\nproductivity should improve SMEs’ internal processes and manufacturing performance.\\nIt is also suggests that environmentally friendly practices help reduce pollution and help\\nSMEs achieve some aspects of their operational objectives (e.g., cost reduction, elimination\\nof liabilities, etc.), which in turn increases competitiveness.\\nThe results show a significant difference in the relationship between relative advantage\\nand AI adoption, AI, and environmental performance. Our study found that, compared\\nwith small SMEs, medium-sized SMEs have a more substantial impact of relative advantage\\non AI adoption in the case of Saudi Arabia. Medium-sized SMEs are considered to adopt AI\\ntechnology better than their existing technology as compared to small SMEs, because large\\nSMEs have sufficient resources and strong infrastructure. Past studies also mentioned that\\nlarge companies adopt AI and the latest technology more quickly than small ones [ 137–139].\\nThe major contribution from the discussion and conclusion of this study lies in un-\\nravelling distinct patterns and determinants of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption within\\nthe context of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia. First, this\\nstudy challenges the existing literature by revealing that the cost of implementation has an\\ninsignificant effect on AI adoption in Saudi SMEs.\\nA significant finding is the positive impact of sustainable human capital on AI adop-\\ntion. This underscores the importance of human resource practices and employee readiness\\nin facilitating the acceptance of AI and other innovations. This study underlines the criticalSustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 17 of 24\\nrole of external factors such as market demand and government support in fostering a\\nconducive environment for AI adoption in Saudi SMEs. Further, this study also indi-\\ncates that the strategic use of AI can lead to simultaneous improvements in economic and\\noperational performance.\\nOne important contribution is that this study found that the relationship between\\nrelative advantage and AI adoption is very different depending on the size of the small\\nbusinesses. Medium-sized SMEs exhibit a more substantial impact, potentially due to their\\nenhanced resources and infrastructure compared to their smaller counterparts.\\n6. Practical, Policy, and Theoretical Implications\\nThe findings of the study indicate that, in contrast to prior research, the economic\\nimplications associated with the adoption of artificial intelligence do not prove to be\\na substantial obstacle for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia.\\nThis suggests that these enterprises have sufficient financial capabilities to allocate funds\\ntowards the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. As a result, Saudi small and medium-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs) have the ability to strategically distribute their resources towards\\nartificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and other new procedures, thereby promoting\\neconomic expansion and enhancing their competitive edge.\\nAcademically, educators have the opportunity to employ these findings in order to\\nenhance business and technology curricula, providing students with practical knowledge\\nregarding the intricacies of AI implementation within the specific framework of small\\nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia. Most of the STEM graduates\\nhave limited seed money and are set up as small startups; hence, the TOE framework,\\nalong with other technology models, can be discussed in the class with empirical evidence.\\nThe examination of the divergent effects of cost and relative benefit on adoption might\\nprovide significant pedagogical resources for comprehending the complexity of technology\\nadoption within various organizational contexts.\\nPolicymakers can utilize the findings of this study in order to customize policies that\\nfacilitate the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) among small and medium-sized enter-\\nprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia. Acknowledging the crucial significance of governmental\\nsupport, policy measures may concentrate on mitigating obstacles such as high expense,\\ndelayed return on investment periods, and problems pertaining to safeguarding intellec-\\ntual property rights. These endeavors aim to foster the adoption of artificial intelligence\\ninitiatives by small and medium-sized enterprises.\\nThis work makes a valuable contribution to the academic community by enhancing our\\ncomprehension of the technological context, organizational readiness, and environmental\\nfactors that impact the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in small and medium-sized\\nenterprises (SMEs) in Saudi Arabia. The comprehensive analysis of the interconnections\\nbetween cost, relative advantage, complexity , organizational support, human capital, market\\ndemand, and government support contributes significantly to the existing body of knowledge.\\n7. Limitations and Future Research Directions\\nThis study faces several limitations. Firstly, in this research, a cross-sectional survey\\nwas undertaken to examine and evaluate hypotheses within the specific setting of Saudi\\nArabia. It is important to note that the outcomes of longitudinal studies conducted in other\\ndeveloping nations may yield dissimilar findings. Furthermore, this survey exclusively\\nfocused on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in the manufacturing\\nsector, while service and non-manufacturing SMEs have not been studied to understand\\nbetter AI adoption and its impact on different performance dimensions. Second, this study\\njustifies the impact of AI on SME performance. The influence of AI on the construction of\\nfinancial, environmental, and operational performance is confirmed in the SME context.\\nHowever, more research is needed to examine other factors that influence the sustainable\\nperformance of SMEs. It is important to acknowledge that the study sample was exclusively\\ndrawn from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, it is advisable forSustainability 2024 ,16, 1864 18 of 24\\nother businesses to exercise caution when attempting to apply these findings, as there may\\nbe inherent disparities that could impact the extent to which these variables influence their\\nrespective industries. Further, future studies must also include ethical concerns as part of\\nsustainable HR practices when it comes to using AI. Making sure that AI technologies are\\nused and administered responsibly is in line with sustainability principles.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.A.S. and S.B.; methodology, S.B. and Y.A.S.; software,\\nY.A.S.; validation, S.B.; formal analysis, Y.A.S.; investigation, S.B.; resources, S.B.; data validation,\\nY.A.S.; writing—original draft preparation, Y.A.S. and S.B.; writing—review and editing, Y.A.S.;\\nvisualization, Y.A.S.; supervision, S.B.; project administration Y.A.S.; funding acquisition, S.B.

This paper examines the factors that influence adoption of AI in industry and government, and the opportunities and risks \\nthat such adoption will entail.\\nThe transformative impact of AI comes from both its effect \\non intelligent decision making and predictions as well as \\nfrom its facilitation of greater automation. While increased \\nautomation has been a key component of technological progress since the industrial revolution,\\n1 AI and Machine \\nLearning (ML) techniques promise far greater automation than before. Automation can bring about lower costs and \\nfaster turnaround time on projects as well as free up human \\ntime for tasks that are less amenable to automation. The effort exerted towards automation can also identify bottlenecks in a project which cause friction and reduce efficiency.\\nIntelligence is an area where the contributions of AI as a \\ntechnology are unique. Such intelligence currently depends on the large volume of data collected,\\n2 and affords greater \\ninsight into operational inefficiencies, a more holistic \\nperspective of an enterprise and its market, and predicted \\ngrowth opportunities. While there are many aspects of intelligence, in this report we focus on prediction, as it \\nis more well-developed and of immediate relevance to \\norganizations. Intelligence, in the form of prediction, \\nprovides unprecedented capabilities for organizations to monitor and improve processes that lead to higher \\nproductivity, efficiency, revenues, profits, and value. One \\nof the relevant technology paradigms for organizational AI adoption is cross-enterprise AI, which links functional silos in an organization and improves cross-functional processes \\nto derive insight. Unlike predictive analytics, which was \\nthe mainstay of prediction in the latter half of the 20th century and early 21st century, AI techniques offer orders of \\nmagnitude more predictive power using advanced statistical \\ntechniques, linked data from multiple sources as well as modelling of the organization, its decisions, and dynamic interactions with its markets or constituents.\\nTo be sure, the adoption of AI also carries with it significant \\nconcerns, particularly with regard to automation and \\nprivacy. There is a risk that automation, if implemented \\nindiscriminately, leads to significant job losses and increased fragility and higher single points of failure.\\n1 Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: \\nWork, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies  (WW \\nNorton & Company, 2014).\\n2 Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb, Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence  (Harvard Business Review \\nPress, 2018).This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the \\ngeneral technological landscape of AI. We then consider \\nseveral models of technological adoption of AI in section \\n3. Section 4 examines concrete use cases from industry and government. Section 5 concludes with our key recommendations regarding AI adoption within government \\nand private industry.\\nLANDSCAPE\\nUnderstanding the contextual landscape around AI is key \\nto utilizing existing and emerging adoption frameworks for \\norganizations. While the consensus is that AI adoption is on \\nthe rise and that organizations should adopt AI sooner rather than later,\\n3 there is no viable “one-size-fits-all” approach to \\nAI adoption. In this section, we give an overview based \\non existing work of the AI landscape. We also discuss the \\ncapabilities, benefits, and transformative impact that AI affords as well as concerns about privacy infringement and unemployment.\\nAs digitization sweeps across industries and governments, \\na shift from institutions to individuals follows in its wake. Consumers are empowered with choices and information \\nabout products, prices, and services, while social media \\nprovides scale to people’s opinions. Traditional industrial-era competitive advantages of scale, capital intensity, reputation, and relationships erode, and force competition \\non price, enriched customer experiences, and fulfillment \\nimmediacy. Thus, organizations require far greater operational agility,\\n4 which AI can provide.\\nAI is a general-purpose technology, such as the steam \\nengine, electricity, microprocessor, and the Internet. Such \\ntechnologies drive waves of change and innovation5 and \\nenable successive developments of new innovations and \\ntransformation of business and operating models. Following \\nare two key aspects of any general-purpose technology: (i) it has a fundamental effect on every aspect of society; and (ii) it increases effectiveness as it drives down the cost of a \\nkey commodity.\\nThe steam engine linked distant regions of the world, \\nfacilitating trade while reducing the cost of transportation. \\nElectricity, with the advent of the light bulb, shifted working \\nhours and lifestyles while reducing the cost of power consumption. More recently, the microprocessor enabled the proliferation of mathematical computation while reducing \\nits cost. The Internet enabled the scope of digitization to \\n3 Jacques Bughin, “Wait-and-See Could Be a Costly AI Strategy,” MIT \\nSloan Management Review , 2017, https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/\\nwait-and-see-could-be-a-costly-ai-strategy/.\\n4 Karin Ahlbäck et al., “How to Create an Agile Organization,” 2017, https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/how-to-create-an-agile-organization.\\n5 Brynjolfsson and McAfee, The Second Machine Age.3\\nAI Adoption Strategies\\nWorking Paper Series – No. 9\\nCentre for Technology and Global Affairs | University of Oxfordspread throughout the world while dramatically reducing \\nthe cost of communication. Internet companies have \\nchanged expectations of individuals as consumers and \\ncitizens, producing pressures for competitive adaptation across business sectors.\\nIn the case of AI, the effectiveness of prediction is rising \\ndramatically as the cost is plummeting with the falling \\ncosts of its enabling technologies.\\n6 Prediction pervades our \\nlives and activities in ways that people scarcely notice but \\nnonetheless rely upon. Clear examples of this trend include \\nembedded AI in consumer products such as driverless cars, smart speakers, and online searches. \\nWhen applied to commercial enterprises or organizations, \\nthe effects of AI profoundly impact institutional performance \\nand society at large. Using internal and external data, organizations can process the proliferation of previously \\nneglected data, enabling organizations to detect prediction \\ndrivers much more precisely, comprehensively, and reliably than before. Predictions driven by multidimensional data enable organizations to supplant narrow, unidimensional \\nconsiderations (often within a single business function), or \\nintuition with an understanding of the dynamic interactions that drive organizational performance. AI enables \\norganizations to replace relatively static operating models \\nwith dynamic decisions and interactions with customers or citizens. It also enables organizations to take actions faster and more frequently by leveraging the recent explosion \\nin data availability and advances in computational power \\nat lower cost. For example, AI is driving significant improvement in business demand forecasts. This enables \\nsupply to be dynamically balanced with demand and leads \\nto increased customer satisfaction and reduced inventory by having the right product on hand at the right place and right time.\\nPredictive government services are broad, ranging from \\nsophisticated weather prediction models, traffic flow, and smart lighting to improved predictions of successful research and development investments to population \\nhealth improvements from the discovery of new \\ntreatments and more precise matching of treatments to patient conditions. \\nWhile AI adoption by organizations is generally beneficial \\nboth for organizations and their employees, there are two areas that AI adopters should especially keep in mind: privacy and employment.\\nPrivacy. Increased intelligence also makes it easier for \\nprivacy infringements to occur. The regulatory climate around privacy is expected to become more stringent with \\ntime as a consequence of tighter regulations, such as the \\nEuropean Union’s General Data Protection Regulation \\n6 Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb, Prediction Machines .(GDPR). In this regard, organizations should ensure that processes involving AI are compliant with privacy \\nregulations. It is also important to consider data storage \\nand access. Data is being heralded as the new oil,\\n7 with \\nits value being derived from being the key input to AI/\\nML algorithms. Secure access and storage of such data \\nshould be a priority for organizations. Even so, as AI/ML technologies become more capable, data which was previously harmless could become valuable for prediction \\nand detection, which in turn could compromise privacy. \\nOrganizations should thus weigh possible privacy tradeoffs against increasing value of data over time due to increased \\ncapabilities.\\nEmployment. The risk to employment from automation is \\nwell-established.\\n8 Studies have shown that, for example, \\nin the United States, up to 47 percent of jobs are at risk \\n— particularly jobs that involve low creativity and high \\nmanual work, such as in transportation. Organizations adopting AI thus should aim to re-skill their workforce. Humans and machines are good at different things; current \\nmachine learning algorithms are often inadequate to deal \\nwith edge cases in decisionmaking, whereas humans are still better than machines at performing inference \\ngiven little data. Human-in-the-loop systems will still \\nbe necessary; organizations should aim to complement human efforts by machines when adopting AI, which also creates job opportunities. This would involve skills \\ntraining to understand the AI techniques being employed \\nand how they fit into organizational decision making, to interpret the output of the algorithms, and to understand \\nthe possible biases and failure modes of the AI systems.\\nADOPTION FRAMEWORKS\\nAdoption of a complex technology such as AI requires \\nconsideration from several viewpoints. Technology \\nadoption by individuals and organizations is a well studied \\ntopic in the information systems’ literature. Here we focus on technology adoption models for firms (see Tiago Oliveira and Maria Fraga Martins\\n9 for a review) such as \\nthe diffusion of innovation (DOI) model;10 the technology, \\norganization, and environment context (TOE) model;11 or \\n7 The Economist, “The World’s Most Valuable Resource Is No Longer Oil, \\nbut Data,” May 2017, https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data.\\n8 Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A Osborne, “The Future of Employment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?” Technological Forecasting and Social Change  114 (2017), pp. 254–80.\\n9 “Literature Review of Information Technology Adoption Models at Firm Level,” Electronic Journal of Information Systems Evaluation  14, no. 1 \\n(2011) p. 110.\\n10 Everett M Rogers, Diffusion of Innovations (Simon; Schuster, 2010).\\n11 Louis G Tornatzky, Mitchell Fleischer, and AK Chakrabarti, “The Processes of Technological Innovation (Issues in Organization and Management Series)” 10 (1990), p. 2013.4\\nAI Adoption Strategies\\nWorking Paper Series – No. 9\\nCentre for Technology and Global Affairs | University of Oxfordthe benefits, organizational readiness, and external pressure \\n(BOE) model.12\\nWhile these frameworks have a common ground, they focus on different facets of technology adoption problems. \\nDOI describes the diffusion of technology, and the factors \\nthat influence it; thus, DOI describes primarily (though not exclusively) the temporal component — the when of technology adoption. The TOE model describes the \\nfactors for technological adoption, focusing on the external \\npressures (e.g. market forces and government regulation), organizational structures, and technological availability. By \\ncontrast, the BOE model combines the organization and \\ntechnology context of TOE into organizational readiness and adds a perceived benefit factor for looking at adoption. Thus, these frameworks describe the why of technological \\nadoption, along with organizational factors. This leaves \\nopen the how of adoption. \\nBelow we consider these three lenses (when, why, and \\nhow) of technological adoption, starting with a review of \\nhow the BOE model fits the AI adoption approach, followed by our own contribution: the functionality, availability, complexity, cost (FACC) model which builds upon the \\nDOI model. Finally, we discuss top down vs. bottom up \\nand build vs. buy approaches for how AI adoption can \\ntake place in organizations. For all these frameworks, we \\nundertake a qualitative, rather than quantitative, discussion \\nof the factors influencing adoption.\\nBOE MODEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL \\nADOPTION\\nThe BOE model was originally developed to understand the \\nadoption of EDI (electronic data interchange) technology, but \\nhas since been used as a general technology adoption model. \\nThe BOE model comprises three factors: external pressure, organizational readiness, and perceived benefits (Figure 1).\\n12 Charalambos L. Iacovou, Izak Benbasat, and Albert S. Dexter, \\n“Electronic Data Interchange and Small Organizations: Adoption and Impact of Technology,” MIS Quarterly 19, no. 4 (1995), pp. 465–85, \\nhttp://www.jstor.org/stable/249629.Perceived benefits. We discussed many of the perceived \\nbenefits of AI in section 2. AI has the benefit of boosting \\norganizational productivity and efficiency. In the case of \\nindustries, this can lead to improved customer support with faster turnarounds as well as improved quality of service. For governments, AI can help develop predictive \\ngovernment services.\\nExternal pressure (competition). Early adoption of \\nAI technologies confers competitive advantage to \\norganizations.\\n13 In the case of industry, this can lead to \\nincreased efficiency, leading to greater manufacturing volume, process, and technological improvements.\\nFor governments, AI offers a strategic advantage, particularly \\nin cybersecurity and the military, strengthening a state’s position in the international order. Like other enabling \\ntechnologies such as electricity and the steam engine, the \\nadoption of AI will lead to changes in global inter-nation power dynamics.\\n14 Various factors such as availability of \\na skilled workforce, the size of the AI industry, private-\\npublic sector partnerships, and regulatory frameworks will \\ndetermine competitiveness of state actors.\\nExternal pressure (Government regulation). So far, the \\nregulatory framework around AI is nascent. Most of the relevant \\nregulations relate to privacy and ownership of personally \\nidentifiable information, the most recent example of that being the GDPR in Europe, which imposed opt-in requirements for \\nsome kinds of data, requirements for data portability, privacy \\nby design, and extra-territorial applicability. While legislation is nascent, several countries have published their AI strategies (see Tim Dutton\\n15 for a review), which include provisions \\nfor development of AI. Most national strategies focus on \\nincreasing research and development in AI, as well as building \\nrelevant skills and speeding up digital transformation which is necessary for AI deployment. Some of them, such as the EU, are concerned about the socioeconomic impact of AI, \\nparticularly the future of employment.\\nIn the short term future, regulation in AI will mostly be \\nsector specific, such as those for drones and driverless cars. \\nOther than such sector specific regulations, some issues \\nthat are of interest to regulators are those of transparency, algorithmic bias, and access to data.\\n16 Algorithmic bias refers \\n13 Sam Ransbotham et al., “Reshaping Business with Artificial Intelligence: \\nClosing the Gap Between Ambition and Action,” MIT Sloan Management Review  59, no. 1 (2017).\\n14 Michael C Horowitz et al., “Strategic Competition in an Era of Artificial Intelligence,” 2018, https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/strategic-competition-in-an-era-of-artificial-intelligence, Center for a New American Society.\\n15 “An Overview of National AI Strategies,” June 2018, https://medium.com/politics-ai/an-overview-of-national-ai-strategies-2a70ec6edfd, Politics + AI.\\n16 UK House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence, “AI in the UK: Ready, Willing and Able?” April 2018, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldai/100/100.pdf.\\nFigure 1.

Particularly in the public sector and organizations \\nusing AI in applications which have an impact on an individual, we can expect guidelines, and later regulations, on fairness, accountability, and transparency requirements. \\nNot all machine learning methods lend themselves well \\nto being explicable, and there could be requirements to use more transparent methods. Greater deployment of AI \\nsystems will also lead to less decisionmaking by humans, \\nthough we expect regulations to ensure human-in-the-loop systems. Such automated decisionmaking raises issues of accountability for the decisions of the AI which \\nare inadequately addressed by present legislation. While \\nsector-specific approaches are being considered, such as for driverless cars, a uniform and consistent approach to \\nthe question of accountability is not in the near future.\\nAccess to data is another issue that is mentioned in national \\nAI strategy reports. Most AI/ML applications require large databases which may be prohibitively expensive to procure \\nfor SMEs. In the meanwhile, we foresee greater use of open \\ndata schemes by organizations as well as the creation of data marketplaces.\\nVarious factors affect organizational readiness; we \\ndiscuss the constraints and enablers that affect adoption of \\nAI. These constraints and enablers are mostly the provision of essential resources (skills, financial and computational \\npower, and data) for AI adoption that are available to an \\norganization.\\nOrganizational readiness (constraints). Organizational \\nconstraints such as culture or lack of skills and human \\nresources to deploy AI will influence how they approach \\nAI adoption.\\n17\\nIndustrial-era structures. The vast majority of \\norganizations are structured according to principles first \\ndeveloped during the 19th century Industrial Revolution \\nby Frederick Taylor to enable efficient operations at scale to service large and stable markets.\\n18 The organization, \\nculture, and IT systems are structured in silos purposefully \\nbounded in horizontal scope of responsibility and \\naccountability and are designed to enable the vertical top-to-bottom flow of command and control throughout the organization.

Even asset-heavy industries, long protected by significant barriers to entry by the need for significant capital investments, are impacted by digital disruption.\\n20\\nLack of skills. This is the most common constraint faced by small to medium scale organizations. Creating, deploying, \\nmaintaining, and interpreting AI/ML systems as well as the \\nknowledge to integrate AI into existing business processes are skills that are in shortage.\\n21\\nBudget constraints. Especially if there is already a lack of skills, budget constraints may prevent the upfront \\ninvestment in hiring and necessary re-training.\\nLack of direction or leadership awareness. A lack of \\nunderstanding of the capabilities that AI brings, particularly \\nin sectors which have so far used AI relatively less such \\nas agriculture, can hinder the adoption of AI. A lack of \\nawareness from the top management can result in AI adoption being limited to silos within the organization, and \\nthus limiting effectiveness\\nCultural Resistance.

This in turn fosters an \\necosystem of free or affordable, easy to use, plug and play \\nservices built on top of these open source frameworks which can be used by organizations that lack the resources and skill sets to develop in-house solutions.\\nData access. Most organizations have rich, yet incomplete \\nand disorganized, data. Often, a mistaken assumption is that \\naccurate data is a necessary prerequisite for AI adoption. \\nWhile access to specialised data sources is still difficult \\nand is a key constraint, there is an increasing availability of open data sets. Such datasets are typically released by governments in open data initiatives, and by non-profit \\norganizations and researchers. The increasing availability of \\nIT products can overcome incomplete and inaccessible data with data supplementation and algorithmic organization. It is \\nalso possible to obtain trained off-the-shelf AI models which \\ncan be used as a component in organizational AI capabilities.\\nComputing power. A decade ago, access to computational \\nresources was an expensive process, usually requiring \\none to obtain dedicated servers. With the advent of cloud \\ncomputing, access to computational power is affordable and convenient. This also allows organizations to only pay for the resources they use.\\nAccess to complete AI solutions. The recent availability \\nof highly functional cross-enterprise products is enabling \\norganizations to adopt AI and realize its benefits within \\nmonths while avoiding the traditional pitfalls of IT \\nadoption, including lengthy and costly systems integration, organization-wide cultural changes, uncertain outcomes, and skills shortages.\\nFACC MODEL AND THE DIFFUSION OF \\nINNOVATIONS\\nIn this section, we consider the temporal component of AI \\nadoption, and introduce a framework based on the well-\\nknown work on the diffusion of innovations,23 as well \\nas Mr. Wendler’s over four decades of experience with adoptions of a many information technologies within a wide \\nrange of vertical industries, geographies, governments, and companies of varying size and competency. We therefore believe the model to be generally applicable to industry and \\ngovernment. The integration of these two constructs enables \\nus to examine the context of users’ adoption considerations at different stages of adoption as revealed by the different \\nintersection profiles of the four factors.\\n23 Rogers, Diffusion of Innovations. The model proposed here draws on \\none of the co-author’s (Steve Wendler’s) more than four decades of experience working on the adoption of information technologies within a wide range of vertical industries, geographies, governments, and companies of varying size and competency.There are four fundamental factors in the model that are \\nconsidered by individuals and organizations when deciding \\nto adopt emerging information technologies: functionality, \\navailability, complexity, and cost (Figure 2).\\nFigure 2. Graphical depiction of a two-dimensional \\nprojection of the FACC model of technology adoption. \\nShaded area is the optimal time for adoption for  \\nmost organizations.\\nFunctionality. Users understandably select a technology for which a problem is solved with varying degrees of functional completeness. When first introduced to the \\nmarket, functionality is typically minimally viable in the \\nform of limited-use tools, sparsely populated software libraries, stand-alone software applications, or other rudimentary forms. Over time, functionality expands with \\nfeedback from users, with advances of the core technology \\nby researchers, and with the development of additional product features by providers. Tool sets or suites emerge; \\nsoftware libraries become densely populated; functional \\nintegration forms off-the-shelf packaged applications and finished solutions. Typically, this increase in functionality is modeled as a simple linear progression through time with \\na positive slope.\\nAvailability. The availability of new technologies in \\nconsumable product form typically increases over time \\nas well. Initially, the availability of products is limited to \\nbeta releases or early commercial versions from a small community of providers and then expands with increasing demand and with the competitive participation of more \\nproviders. We again choose to model this dynamic as a \\nsimple linear progression over time with a positive slope.\\nComplexity. The complexity of adoption is inversely related \\nwith varying degrees to its functionality and availability. \\nComplexity is at its peak with initial product availability \\nand falls over time as users gain experience and providers add functionality to simplify installation and maintenance. complexity\\ncost\\ntimefunctionality\\navailability7\\nAI Adoption Strategies\\nWorking Paper Series – No. 9\\nCentre for Technology and Global Affairs | University of OxfordThe complexity of adoption varies significantly with the \\ncomplexity of the technology itself, the requirement of \\nintegration of the technology with existing systems, the \\ndegree of impact on the adopting firms’ workflows, the size and complexity of the adopting organization as training and education becomes prevalent, and more. We model these \\nfactors as a linear progression over time with a negative \\nslope.\\nCost. Like complexity, the cost of technology adoption is \\ninversely related to its functionality and availability. The \\ncost is typically at its peak with initial product releases and decreases over time as a growing community of providers compete on price, as economies of scale are engaged, as \\ncompeting technologies become available, and other \\nfactors. Again, we choose to model this factor as a linear progression over time with a negative slope.\\nOf course, reality significantly departs from these simple \\nlinear progressions. All four factors are episodic and not \\ncontinuous, and the slope varies significantly with events. Nonetheless, the combination of the factors serves as a \\nuseful reference in understanding organizations’ adoption \\nstrategies.\\nAt any point in time during a technology adoption, the \\nintersection of the four factors forms different profiles \\nwhich indicates the variation in adoption strategies and \\norganizations’ characteristics.\\nThe adoption of emerging information technologies, \\nincluding AI, has traditionally evolved as described by \\nRogers as the diffusion of innovations and the famous S curve, where the curve is segmented in three phases of experimentation, proliferation, and maturation. Each phase \\nexhibits a different intersection of the four factors as well as \\ndifferent adoption methods and user characteristics.\\nExperimentation. The adoption of every emerging \\ntechnology begins with the experimentation phase when \\nearly adopters seek to achieve the earliest and strongest \\nvalue creation and/or competitive advantage. They exhibit high tolerance for a very limited supply of first-available, \\nexpensive, and relatively crude versions of products with \\nlimited functionality. Adoption is funded by budgets set aside for business growth and transformational investments. Adoption is undertaken with highly experienced personnel \\nwithin carefully bounded laboratories frequently referred to \\nas centres of excellence. There, isolated from organizations’ core processes, staff are able to explore narrowly-defined, \\nlimited-impact, and tactical applications so as to accumulate \\nskills in a low-risk environment.\\nProliferation. As both providers and organizations move \\nup the steep learning curve, mainstream technology \\nadopters acquire the next available versions of products \\nwhich have become more functionally complete and less complex to adopt. The risk of adoption is exhaustively explored by moderately skilled personnel, prices drop with increased competition, and the scope and scale of \\napplications broadens from the periphery to core processes \\nand operations. The leading edge of this period marks an inflection point of the favourable convergence of factors which engages “fast followers”\\n24 seeking proven value \\ncreation and/or moderate competitive advantage. The fast \\nfollowers are accompanied by rapid expansion and pace of \\nadoption which characterizes the proliferation phase.\\nMaturation. The maturation phase follows and is \\ncharacterized by late adopters whose conservative adoption \\nstrategies wait until highly-functional products are widely \\navailable from a multitude of suppliers at reasonable prices and the complexities of adoption have been minimized. \\nTypically, this is the phase in which substantial value \\ncreation may still be achieved in the form of reduced costs but competitive advantage is not probable.\\nAs of this writing, we believe the four factors have \\nfavourably converged in the aggregation for the adoption \\nof AI. Highly functional AI products have become recently available which enable organizations to achieve strategic and organization-wide value while avoiding the daunting \\ncomplexities and exorbitant costs of traditional IT adoption. \\nThus, we believe the aggregate market for AI is at the cusp of entering the proliferation stage of organization-wide, \\nstrategic AI adoption; that this trend and will grow over the \\nnext decade as individual organizations’ adoption strategies are executed.\\nUnderlying and driving Rogers’ model of the diffusion of \\ninnovations is the uniform and continuous transmission \\nof innovations throughout any given network of users. While this has been demonstrated countless times over \\nmany decades, a more recent and disturbing phenomenon \\nhas appeared to disrupt this model. While innovative IT practices of industry leaders in many American industries have generated competitive advantage, they \\nhave remained proprietary and thus have not diffused to \\nother industry participants per usual. This disruption of the flow of advantageous knowhow is correlated with the \\nconcentration of market power within those industries. This \\nphenomenon, apparently achieved through the expanded use of trade secrets and employee non-compete agreements, has troubling implications for fairness of competition \\nand indicates the need for consideration by public policy \\nexperts.\\n25\\n24  Ransbotham et al., “Reshaping Business with Artificial Intelligence.”\\n25  James E Bessen, “The Policy Challenge of Artificial Intelligence,” CPI \\nAntitrust Chronicle , June 2018, https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3219887.8\\nAI Adoption Strategies\\nWorking Paper Series – No. 9\\nCentre for Technology and Global Affairs | University of OxfordTOP-DOWN VS. BOTTOM-UP, BUY \\nVS. BUILD\\nTop-down approach. The top-down approach is driven by \\nboards and senior management or, in the case of government, \\ntop officials and ministers. Such an approach takes a holistic, \\nstrategic viewpoint on technology adoption and makes it an organization-wide priority. This approach takes into account desired outcomes for the commercial organization, \\nsuch as improved customer relations, access to customer \\ndata, and greater throughput and/or productive capacity, and frequently delivers the highest value. For governments, \\ndesired outcomes include efficient and seamless access to \\nservices. Regardless, the top-down approach links them directly to high-level behaviour and process changes in the organization that are enabled by technology. This approach \\nenables the establishment of organization-wide standards.\\nSeveral potential disadvantages of this approach can arise \\nfrom the resources required by large complex organizations. \\nAdoption strategies that require organization-wide cultural \\nchange can be both distracting and exhausting. Consider the sustained attention to multi-year coordination of hundreds or thousands of agile teams as proposed by Darrell K. \\nRigby, Jeff Sutherland, and Andy Noble.\\n26 This all-or-\\n26  “Agile at Scale,” Harvard Business Review , May 2018, https://hbr.\\norg/2018/05/agile-at-scale.nothing approach often fails to account the complexity \\nof large organizations and the resources required for a \\nfrictionless transition. Particularly for organizations that are \\nnew to the technology, a bottom-up approach can often be more practical, readily achievable, and carry less financial and reputational risk.\\nGiven the general-purpose nature and predictive power of \\nAI, its greatest value is achieved from adoptions which transform organization-wide operating models on a large \\nscale. Given the recent availability of off-the-shelf products \\nwhich enable organizations to seize the strategic benefits of AI on an incremental use case basis, all-or-nothing organization-wide cultural change can often be avoided.\\nBottom-up approach. A bottom-up approach, in contrast, \\napplies technology to the various components and processes in an organization and in a piecemeal manner, providing tactical competitive advantages and low business value. \\nSuch an approach has the benefit of relatively low risk and \\nservices can be transitioned one at a time. A drawback is that a bottom-up approach can take more time, which could \\nlead to competitive disadvantage. Another disadvantage is \\nthat it usually involves technology adoption in silos, which prevents integration that is often the primary benefit of the technology.\\nFew information technologies are truly general-purpose \\nand potentially transformative.

Traditional build approaches develop \\ncustom solutions involving the hiring of specialized \\ninternal staff (such as data scientists), investing in training \\nand tools and technology, or investing in elaborate IT systems integration projects that frequently consume years \\nto produce uncertain or disappointing results. In late 2015, \\nMcKinsey Global Institute surveyed nearly a thousand C-suite executives and found that two-thirds of C-suite executives expect revenue and profit increases of 5 to 15 \\npercent  from digital initiatives. Simultaneously over half \\nof C-suite executives believe they are realizing less than 20 percent of the expected value.\\n27 The advantage of the build \\napproach is that it results in a custom, proprietary solution \\nwhich can provide sustained competitive advantage, \\nparticularly if key personnel can be retained. In addition, in-depth in-house knowledge of the AI system provides resilience.\\nBuy Approach. The buy approach is typically engaged \\nwhen commercially available products are available which partially or fully satisfy the functional requirements of \\nthe application. This approach has the major advantage \\nof time-to-operation. Providers frequently have a library of templates and use cases that are readily available and configurable for selected industries. The buy approach also \\naffords the opportunity to leverage the providers’ expertise, \\nexperience, and staff. This is particularly valuable in the case of AI considering the current worldwide shortage of \\ndata scientists. The buy approach can enable organizations \\nto achieve desired outcomes while avoiding a prerequisite organization-wide changes to culture and workflows thus allowing organizational change to occur at a designated pace.\\nUSE CASES\\nIn this section, we consider several use cases which explore how our adoption framework relates to existing instances \\nof AI adoption. While we consider specific examples, our \\nadoption framework is general.\\nAI ADOPTION IN UK GOVERNMENT\\nIn this section we discuss the current state of the art in AI adoption in the UK government in relation to the adoption \\nframeworks presented in the previous section.\\nIn the UK, the government has recognized the importance of \\n27 Jacques Bughin, Andy Holley, and Anette Mellbye, “Cracking the Digital \\nCode,” September 2015, https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/cracking-the-digital-code.AI adoption, both in encouraging industry and in using AI \\nto deliver better services to its citizens. In terms of the BOE \\nmodel, the benefits of AI adoption in the UK, like for other \\ngovernments, lies in building competitive advantage and skills in AI, which will play an important role in preparing society for the increased automation and skills displacement that is \\nlikely to occur as AI adoption gains pace. Other countries \\nhave also published AI strategies to increase investment and education in AI, as well as the use of AI in public services, \\nwhich is an external pressure for nations to adopt AI.\\nIn terms of organizational readiness, the UK is well-\\npositioned to take advantage of its well-established service and technology sector to take a lead in AI adoption. It \\nhas committed to establishing the Government Office on \\nArtificial Intelligence and a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation alongside an AI Council, which will have \\nmembers from academia, industry, and the public sector. \\nThe UK also has an established open data initiative\\n28 which \\nis essential for promoting AI applications, particularly \\nfrom SMEs and startups. Some cities have also established \\nreal-time data collection and availability on metrics such as traffic flow and crime. London has its own open data repository,\\n29 and Glasgow30 is using technology, including \\nAI, to transform into a smart city. Smart lighting and a \\nunified operations centre, among other innovative efficiency \\ngains, has given a return on investment of £144 million.31\\nGovernments have different priorities compared to industry and other organizations. Its primary interest is the safety \\nand security of its citizens as well as providing essential \\nservices. From the point of view of when to adopt (FACC model), governments should not be expected to adopt AI as quickly as commercial organizations. By their very nature, \\ngovernments are risk-averse. Nevertheless, governments \\nshould start preparing for AI and developing AI strategies to be competitive in attracting talent, ensuring a sustainable \\nadoption of AI, and building a strategic advantage in a key \\ntechnology.\\n32 With regards to top-down vs. bottom-up and \\nbuild vs. buy, we believe governments should utilise a \\ncombination of the approaches. In applications critical to \\nsecurity, governments should invest in in-house talent, if not to build, but at least to understand AI algorithms and frameworks. Strategic partnerships can be formed and \\nincubators established to encourage growth of the AI sector. \\nThe UK has already set out a white paper on an AI Sector \\n28 UK Government Open Data Service, https://data.gov.uk/.\\n29 London Datastore, https://data.london.gov.uk/.\\n30 Future City Glasgow (Smart City Programme), http://futurecity.glasgow.\\ngov.uk.\\n31 UK Government Case Study, “Glasgow a World-Leading Smart City with Support from Innovate UK,” November 2017, https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/glasgow-a-world-leading-smart-city-with-support-from-innovate-uk.\\n32 Horowitz et al., “Strategic Competition in an Era of Artificial Intelligence.”10\\nAI Adoption Strategies\\nWorking Paper Series – No. 9\\nCentre for Technology and Global Affairs | University of OxfordDeal33 that recommends against the ‘wait and see’ approach, \\nand recommends increasing investment in R&D, investing in \\nSTEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) \\neducation, and a National Retraining Scheme that will support re-skilling people in new digital technologies. Enabling partnerships with industry with initiatives such as \\nthe GovTech Catalyst\\n34 challenge will also drive adoption of \\nAI. With regard to the top-down vs. bottom-up approaches, we believe that for most governments, a top-down approach \\nis better to drive the required adoption of AI. Without support from the highest echelons of government, it is not possible to derive the transformative benefits of AI in the public sector.\\nData-driven policy is an area where we expect to see \\nmore investment in governments in the near future. In particular, linked datasets can offer insights driven by AI \\nthat can submit feedbacks to governments about policy \\nimplementations. This can lead to smaller cycles from policy draft to legislation and to implementation.\\nAI ADOPTION IN RETAIL, CONSUMER \\nGOODS, AND EQUIPMENT RENTAL\\nAI is being applied to some of the most vexing business \\nproblems today and virtually all use cases involve prediction. \\nIn several sectors, machine learning is being applied \\nto demand forecasting, store assortment optimization, delivery optimization, and sales optimization. We give a few examples from client work done by r4.\\nIn one case, a regional beverages company with tens of \\nthousands of vending machines deployed in the field exhibited the characteristics of an early adopter (organizational \\nreadiness). AI functionality at the time of the adoption in the \\nmid-2000’s was in the experimentation stage. Functionality was primitive relative to today’s standards, and availability of hardware and software was extremely limited. Telemetry \\nhardware was commercially unavailable, requiring custom \\ndesign and manufacturing. The complexity of the integration of the hardware and software components was very high. \\nThe solution was essentially first-of-a-kind and the cost \\nwas very high. Nonetheless, the firm engaged in a top-down approach driven by executive management’s quest for competitive advantage (perceived benefit). Machine \\nlearning was used to generate reliable recommendations for \\nthe right assortment at the stock-keeping unit (SKU) level for each of the machines – creating deep granular insights \\nof the specific demand characteristics of the machines. \\nDynamic demand forecasting based on those local demand drivers then enabled the company to fulfill local demand \\n33 UK Government Policy Paper, “AI Sector Deal,” April 2018, https://\\nwww.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-sector-deal/ai-sector-deal.\\n34 UK Government Guidance - the GovTech challenge process, https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-govtech-catalyst-challenge-process.(external pressure) in a more agile way, resulting in double-\\ndigit increases in sales and a shift of its delivery model from \\nlarge, heavily stocked trucks to smaller trucks carrying the \\npredicted replenishment stocks.\\nIn the consumer packaged goods industry, technology \\nadoption was significantly different given the progression \\nof technologies and products from the experimentation \\nto the proliferations stage in the roughly ten-year period following the previous example. In this case, an aggressive \\nglobal hard-goods company, also employing a top-\\ndown approach, was driven by the pursuit of competitive advantage (perceived benefit, external pressure). But, they chose to buy rather than build. This approach was enabled \\nby the commercial availability of a highly-functional AI, \\na software-as-a-service solution as well as the widespread commercial availability of open-source software and \\nrelatively low-cost and high-capacity clusters of computing \\npower (organizational readiness). The highly-integrated nature of the AI solution avoided the need for custom design and manufacturing and extensive systems integration. This \\ngreatly reduced the complexity, cost, and time-to-adoption. \\nThis solution replaced a weeks-long, spreadsheet-based, and global demand forecast process primarily based on \\nhistorical sales data with a continuously updated and refined \\ndemand forecast. The system currently generates specific SKU sales forecasts derived from the integration of actual demand data from retail outlets enabling better decisions \\nand faster actions for each SKU, each channel, at each outlet. \\nThis precise and dynamic approach to demand forecasting resulted in a double-digit increase in forecast accuracy and \\nis projected to enable major supply chain efficiencies of \\nhundreds of millions of inventories.\\nIn the construction rental equipment industry, sales prospect \\ntargeting has been optimized through the generation of \\nprioritized sales opportunities. Machine learning was \\nemployed to analyze patterns and generate predicted revenue of each opportunity using multidimensional data consisting of the customers’ needs, preferences, prior rental \\nbehaviour, proximity of competitors, competitors’ available \\nrental inventory (external pressure), nearby construction project starts, competitive pricing, and more. The results \\nof the adoption were double-digit increases in sales and \\nimproved inventory utilization (perceived benefit). This use case was driven by the same four factors as the previous two examples. The approach was similar to the previous \\nuse case where the same highly-functional, commercially-\\navailable, and highly-integrated AI solution (organizational readiness) significantly lowered the complexity of adoption. \\nComplexity was further reduced by the distribution of \\nthe generated opportunities to the sales representatives through the company’s existing customer relationship management system. All three examples demonstrate the \\napplicability of the framework with variations of industries \\nand technological maturity.11\\nAI Adoption Strategies\\nWorking Paper Series – No. 9\\nCentre for Technology and Global Affairs | University of OxfordCONCLUSION: RECOMMENDATIONS \\nFOR ACTION\\nIn this article, we described various adoption strategies for \\nAI along with their respective advantages and disadvantages \\nusing existing adoption frameworks. We also introduced a \\ngeneral technological adoption framework that builds on existing theories of technological diffusion. Overall, we believe organizations should adopt AI sooner rather than \\nlater, while keeping in mind their requirements and the \\nconcerns around adoption that we highlighted. We conclude with recommendations for AI adoption for industry and \\ngovernment. While there are significant variations by \\nindustry, geography, competitive intensity, organization size, competence, and other factors, we believe we have provided representative, if not exhaustive, demonstration of the general applicability of the discussed AI adoption \\nframeworks to industry and government.\\nINDUSTRY\\n1. Aggressively adopt AI. For those pressured by \\nstrategic and urgent competitive threats, hesitation is not an option. CPG, retail, and media are \\nexperiencing intense pressure from the tech giants and early adopters. In other industries with different dynamics, sometimes waiting can be a winning \\nstrategy. However, depending on the intensity of \\nthe competition, this could be costly, particularly when implementing AI. Surveys conducted by \\nthe consulting firm McKinsey & Co. suggest that \\nthe competitive intensity of implementing AI is \\naccelerating. Early adopters in retail, transportation, financial services, and manufacturing are expecting 20 \\npercent higher profit growth, with roughly half of that \\ncoming at the expense of their competitors. McKinsey argues that the longer firms hesitate, the more likely \\nthe revenue and profit gains from AI implementation \\nwill dissipate. They advise the decisive rejection of the wait-and-see approach to AI and the pursuit of implementation at scale as soon as feasible to share in \\nthe estimated $1 trillion shift in profits from slower-\\nmoving companies.35\\n2. Prefer buy over build. The availability of AI \\ncommercial-off-the-shelf products that organizations could buy to fulfill organization-wide strategies \\ndid not exist until recently. Implementations of \\nAI on a large scale (excluding the digital-native technology giants) have been either extensive and \\nexpensive custom-built internal projects or systems \\nintegration projects. Commensurate with the early stages of AI, offerings labeled as enterprise AI \\n35  Bughin, “Wait-and-See Could Be a Costly AI Strategy.”for businesses and government have been little early versions of tools and software libraries \\ntargeted at application developers for the creation \\nof narrowly-focused, tactical applications isolated from core, cross-functional processes that directly interface with markets, customers or constituents.  \\n However, a new category of cross-enterprise AI has emerged with several providers offering full suites \\nAI functionality, enabling organizations to avoid the \\npitfalls of internal custom-built applications. The decision to buy AI products is particularly relevant given the projected worldwide shortage of data \\nscientists with advanced degrees and several years of \\nwork experience.\\n36\\n3. Employ the top-down approach. Organizations continue to struggle to fulfill the ambitions of senior \\nexecutives to transform from industrial operations to \\ndigital operations at scale. Now that highly functional commercial-off-the-shelf products are becoming available that strategically apply AI to core and cross-\\nfunctional processes, these ambitions can be achieved. \\nTypically, these products are operational within a year and enable significant progress toward organizational \\ngoals with relatively modest investments and without \\nprerequisite organization-wide changes to culture, established infrastructure of IT systems, or workflows.\\nGOVERNMENT\\n1. Building a skilled workforce. The advent of AI is going \\nto change the nature of employment in multiple sectors. \\nParticularly, manual and routine jobs are susceptible to \\nautomation. Alongside, new jobs will be created which will require a skilled workforce adept at understanding and working with automation. To take advantage of the \\nopportunities that AI offers, and to offset the negative \\nimpact of job displacement, governments should invest in building a skilled workforce and education at all \\nlevels. Having a skilled workforce also gives greater \\nstrategic autonomy to governments.\\n2. Form strategic industry partnerships. Governments \\nshould foster an environment conducive to AI startups, \\nand form partnerships with industry for public sector \\nprojects. Such partnerships can be mutually beneficial and enable faster adoption of AI by governments.\\n3. Open data sets. Governments collect a wealth of data \\non their citizens and the services they provide, such as in employment, crime, demographic data, traffic flows, and health. Currently, very few governments have open \\n36 Markow et al., “The Quant Crunch.”12\\nAI Adoption Strategies\\nWorking Paper Series – No. 9\\nCentre for Technology and Global Affairs | University of Oxforddata initiatives. Such initiatives to promote open data \\nallow startups and established players to employ AI/\\nML techniques to deliver insight. While data is vital to \\nthe functioning of an AI-enabled government, it often lacks in-house skills to make use of that. Making non-sensitive data open to the public invites participation \\nfrom multiple stakeholders, as well as democratizing \\naccess to valuable data, which can help startups and SMEs.\\n4. Establish entities to oversee AI adoption.  \\nEstablishment of entities like the AI Council and the Government Office for AI in the UK are a key step in ensuring successful adoption of AI by governments \\nand societies. Such entities would be tasked with the \\ndevelopment of guidelines and ethical codes of conduct for industry to ensure that the manifold benefits of AI \\nare used for public good. These would also be proactive \\nin monitoring AI adoption and raising awareness of any issues.\\n5. Engage public and awareness campaigns. Finally, \\ngovernments have the duty to engage the public in its AI adoption strategy. As mentioned in Landscape, the adoption of AI carries with it concerns such as those of privacy and jobs displacement due to automation. It \\nis thus vital that governments communicate clearly to their citizens the impact that AI adoption might have \\non them as individuals, and on society as a whole. Any \\nadoption of AI that has privacy concerns or risks a rise \\nin unemployment should be discussed with relevant stakeholders, the industry, workers, and the general public.\\n6. Selectively adopt AI. Governments have different \\nrequirements from industries and provide a wide gamut of services to their citizens. We recommend that \\ngovernments adopt AI in selected departments where \\nprivacy risks are low, such as in tax fraud detection or traffic flow prediction by cities. Overall, governments should also develop in-house skills to develop and \\nmaintain their own AI applications, particularly where \\ndata privacy is a concern, and where AI becomes part of critical national infrastructure.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the sponsorship of  \\nr4 Technologies, and the guidance, support, and \\ncontributions of Ralf-Dieter Wagner and Lucas Kello.13\\nThe Centre for Technology and Global Affairs at Oxford \\nUniversity is a global research and policy-building initiative \\nfocusing on the impact of technology on international \\nrelations, government, and society.
